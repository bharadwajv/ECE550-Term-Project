% nodal analysis%
Create Y bus
Find Gen Bus
FindIg for Gen bus
find Il for load bus
take contingency
create new ybus
perform nodal analysis.
output the voltages and angles



Read the data from the load bus data and create the ybus
Generate a output file with the ybus alone 
Check with power flow
Newton Raphson method
Do nodal analysis

find the current injections
use the y bus file to start the problem
generate the output file
