The Version 2.8 has the following features
- Extract the folder completely and then run the program in MATLAB.
- There has to be 4 files of .M format - 2 input files(DTS, PWRFLW4BUS_IEEE), Ybus, ntwrkanalysis.  
- Run the Ybus.m file first. Then run the ntwrkanalysis.m file.
- The code has been generated for performing multiple contingency line outage analysis of a generic power system.
- It takes input in the form of IEEE std power system data.
- The software automatically generates the current systems ybus.
- To perform the contingency, you are required to provide the bus details between which you would like to perform a line outage.
- To ease the user, upon providing the 'from bus' details, you will be shown all the available branches for the current selection.
- Upon providing the 'To bus' details, the code generates an output file with all the contingency conditions checked along with the time stamping.
- The final output will be available in the 'output.m' file
- Sample outputs have been attached in the zip for reference.
